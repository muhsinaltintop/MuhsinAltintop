        Effortless Deployment: Automating GitHub Repository Deployment via FTP
      </h1>
      <p>
        In the realm of modern development workflows, automating deployment
        processes is paramount to boosting efficiency and productivity. One
        effective way to achieve this is by automatically deploying code from a
        GitHub repository to a web server via FTP (File Transfer Protocol). In
        this guide, we'll walk through the streamlined process of setting up
        automatic deployment for your GitHub repository to an FTP server,
        empowering you to deploy changes seamlessly with each push.
      </p>
      <h2>Step 1: Set Up FTP Credentials as Secrets</h2>
      <p>
        After creating a GitHub repository, the first step is to establish an
        FTP connection. Head over to your hosting provider's platform and create
        a new FTP account. Make sure to note down the FTP server link, FTP
        username, and FTP password.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, navigate to your GitHub repository's settings and go to "Settings"
        > "Secrets and Variables" > "Actions" tab. Here, create three new
        secrets named "ftp_server", "ftp_username", and "ftp_password", and
        respectively paste the FTP server link, username, and password into
        each.
      </p>
      <h2>Step 2: Configure Deployment Workflow</h2>
      <p>
        Now, let's set up the deployment workflow. Within your repository,
        navigate to the "Actions" tab and click on "Set up a workflow yourself".
        In the code editor that opens, paste the following YAML configuration:
      </p>
      <pre>
      
        on: push
        name: ðŸš€ Deploy website on push
        jobs:
          web-deploy:
            name: ðŸŽ‰ Deploy
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
            - name: ðŸšš Get latest code
              uses: actions/checkout@v4
            
            - name: ðŸ“‚ Sync files
              uses: SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@v4.3.5
              with:
                server: ${{ secrets.ftp_server }}
                username: ${{ secrets.ftp_username }} 
                password: ${{ secrets.ftp_password }}
      
    </pre
      >
      <p>
        This workflow listens for pushes to your repository and triggers
        deployment automatically. It retrieves the latest code, then syncs the
        files to your FTP server using the specified credentials.
      </p>
      <h2>Step 3: Deploy with Ease</h2>
      <p>
        With the workflow in place, clone the repository to your local machine
        using Git commands. From now on, every push to your repository will
        trigger deployment to your website, ensuring that your changes are
        promptly reflected online.
